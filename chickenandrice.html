    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>chicken - 1, about 3.5 lb (1.5 kg)</li>
        <li>onions - 2 heads</li>
        <li>carrots - 1</li>
        <li>peppers - 1</li>
        <li>rice - 1 2/3 cups (400 g)</li>
        <li>oil - 2 2/3 tbsp (40 ml) for frying</li>
        <li>butter - 2 2/3 tbsp (40 ml)</li>
        <li>black pepper - 10 grains + some to taste</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After you make sure to have all the ingredients ready, you can follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Portion the chicken (wings, legs and white meat), leave the backbone whole. Wash them very well and put in a pot.</li>
        <li>Pour in cold water and add salt (1 tsp salt for every 4 1/5 cups (1 L) water). Once it reaches boiling point,
            remove the resulting foam. Chop 1 onion head finely and add it to the boiling chicken along 
            with the black pepper grains and whole pepper and carrot. Boil until the meat is semi-ready.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, wash the rice very well under running water while rubbing the grains in 
            between your palms. Then put them in a bowl with slightly salted cold water.</li>
        <li>Chop the other onion head finely. Heat the oil in a pan and braise the onions briefly, add the rice and braise about 3-4 min.</li>
        <li>Distribute the braised riced evenly in a tray, distribute the portioned meat (without the backbone) on top.</li>
        <li>In the bowl/cup in which you measured out your rice, pour broth from the chicken and pour it into the tray; do this 3 times.</li>
        <li>Salt to taste if needed. Chop the butter into cubes and distribute them evenly on top. Put the tray in a preheated 360°F (180 °C) oven and bake until the rice is ready - about 40 min.</li>
        <li>Take the tray out of the oven and wrap it with a clean, dense towel, to smother it for 10-15 min.</li>
        <li>From the boiled chicken backbone, along with the pepper, carrot and remaining broth, make a chicken soup.</li>
    </ol>
