    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Less work than traditional moussaka and gluten-free, our Greek-style bake of 
        potatoes and aubergines layered with lamb mince is topped with crème fraîche</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>    
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium-sized potatoes</li>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 red onion, sliced</li>
        <li>500g lamb mince</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>1 tsp mixed spice</li>
        <li>500g carton passata</li>
        <li>2 aubergines, cut into slices</li>
        <li>300ml tub creme fraiche</li>
        <li>140g cheddar, grated</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After you make sure to have all the ingredients ready, you can follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the potatoes whole for 20 mins or just until tender. Drain and allow to cool.</li>
        <li>Return the pan to the heat and add 2 tbsp olive oil and the onion. Cook until softened, then add the lamb. Fry the mince for 5 mins or 
            until cooked through and starting to char. Add the garlic and spice, and stir in the passata. 
            Bring to a simmer, then season to taste, take off the heat and set aside until needed.</li>
        <li>Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Warm a griddle pan over a high heat and brush a little oil over the aubergines. 
            Grill for 2-3 mins each side or until char lines appear. You may have to do this in 3-4 batches.</li>
        <li>Once cool enough to handle, cut the boiled potatoes into thick slices. Put 1 tbsp oil in the base of a deep ovenproof 
            dish and start with a layer of potatoes, then aubergines, a 
            sprinkling of seasoning, then a layer of the lamb mixture. Repeat until all the mixture is used up, 
            ending with a layer of aubergines. Spread the crème fraîche over the top and scatter with the 
            cheese. Put in the oven for 10 mins or until the cheese is golden.</li>
    </ol>
